# CVproject

This repository contains a computer vision project implemented using Python and Jupyter notebooks. The project is divided into three phases, each addressing a specific aspect of computer vision.

## Project Structure

- `phase1CRCV.ipynb`: Initial phase of the computer vision project.
- `phase2CRCV.ipynb`: Second phase, building upon the first.
- `phase3CRCV.ipynb`: Final phase, incorporating advanced techniques like MobileNetV2.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CVproject.git
   cd CVproject
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in your browser and run the cells sequentially to execute the project phases.
